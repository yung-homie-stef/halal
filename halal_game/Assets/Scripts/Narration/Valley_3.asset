  nonlinearPhrases:
  - Frollicking in the fields, suckling from the teat, amounting to little beyond
    a slow-roasted shank or gyro filling. Just a quick and merciful demise once the
    curved blade cuts.
  - Instead it is thrown to the lions and picked clean from its bones. Eaten alive
    by the same maws that no sooner sing its praise before returning for seconds.
  - Poor thing should have just been laid out to pasture. There's nothing to save
    in Man.
